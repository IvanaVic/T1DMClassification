# T1DMClassification
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease marked by the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic Î²-cells. This project employs a comprehensive machine learning approach to classify T1DM using gene expression data from 105 samples (81 diabetic and 24 non-diabetic), analyzing 22,283 genes. Multiple feature selection techniques, including Chi-square, ANOVA, Mutual Information, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), are implemented alongside various machine learning classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost. The best classification performance is achieved using PCA with both SVM and Logistic Regression, reaching a test accuracy of 0.905. The analysis identifies 661 genes consistently selected across three different feature selection methods, with five genes (CSDE1, PTRF, OTC, MARCO, and ANXA4) showing particular significance. Although direct links between these genes and T1DM have not been established in the literature, their known roles in immune response, metabolic regulation, and cell viability suggest potential involvement in T1DM pathogenesis.
# Limitation
The relatively small sample size, particularly in the non-diabetic group (24 samples), may limit the generalizability of this project. Future
work should focus on validating these findings in larger, more diverse patient populations and investigating the biological mechanisms through which the identified genes might influence T1DM development.
